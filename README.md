# What is this?

This is the project of my personal blog build on [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

# How?

After I commit changes to this repo, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) will automaticly start to build md files into static html files and deploy to my github page repo on [zhcHoward.github.io](https://zhcHoward.github.io).

# TODO List

- [ ] Change layout of index page.
- [ ] Customize theme.
- [ ] Use code to automaticly generate items in navbar instead of manully modifing it.
- [ ] Write custome components for more markdown tags, e.g. `$$`.
